A sales invoice is an accounting document that records a business transaction.   
It provide the business with a record of the services theyâ€™ve provided to a client, 
when the services were rendered and how much money the client owes the business.
It should include a description of the service provided, and the amount owed. 
Sales invoices are crucial to small-business accounting because they enable you to record
transactions of your sales for bookkeeping purposes.
